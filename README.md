In memory of a friend, [Joshua (Josh) Jeremiah Blackledge](https://www.noebrooks.net/obituaries/joshua-blackledge), also known on tiktok as [mommyjoshua/f30joshh](https://www.tiktok.com/@f30joshh).

[Resource Master List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jFqhlUl2z-daZqBdE6tfpbf9JqXBza9PZ9J_aQ9rqas/edit?usp=sharing)


After learning of Josh's passing, my girlfriend and I created this site, in his memory, to try and do what we can to prevent tragedies such as this. We are aiming to collect resources from all 50 states, and some countries and provide them to those who need them.

The site is based off of basic IP geolocation, based on your state from your IP, it will show you the resources for that state. If you need to search for a different state/country, it will also give you that option.


This site is open source, and will stay open source. Resources by state/country can be found in the appropriate folders.

    - Look, I can code, but not this well. ChatGPT, as stupid as it sounds, helped with quite a bit of code and translate a lot of garbage I wrote in python into HTML/JS (yes, this started out as a python script).
 
## USA - Advocate for Change

All 50 states are active and on the site, however, the following states do NOT have their own program suicide prevention program, and just list national resources rather than their own:

Florida
Georgia
Hawaii
Idaho
Illinois
Inddiana
Kentucky
Louisiana
Mississipi
Ohio
Oklahoma
Oregon
South Dakota


For those who live in those states: email or call your state representatives and senators, talk to local school counselors, principals, or district officials about adding or improving mental health programs, attend city hall meetings and speak about making a change. **(37) THIRTY SEVEN** states have some level of in-state program, these 13 (as of writing, 3/21/2025), do not.
