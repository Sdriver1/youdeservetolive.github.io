In memory of a friend, [Joshua (Josh) Jeremiah Blackledge](https://www.noebrooks.net/obituaries/joshua-blackledge), also known on tiktok as [mommyjoshua/f30joshh](https://www.tiktok.com/@f30joshh).

[Resource Master List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jFqhlUl2z-daZqBdE6tfpbf9JqXBza9PZ9J_aQ9rqas/edit?usp=sharing)


After learning of Josh's passing, my girlfriend and I created this site, in his memory, to try and do what we can to prevent tragedies such as this. We are aiming to collect resources from all 50 states, and some countries and provide them to those who need them.

The site is based off of basic IP geolocation, based on your state from your IP, it will show you the resources for that state. If you need to search for a different state/country, it will also give you that option.


This site is open source, and will stay open source. Resources by state/country can be found in the appropriate folders.


41/50 states are active right now except:

South Carolina\
South Dakota\
Tennessee\
Texas\
Utah\
Vermont\
Virginia\
Washington\
West Virginia\
Wisconsin\
Wyoming\
